# SIMPSON-PULSE-SEQUENCES
Simpson pulse sequences

Installed in Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS by simply downloading simpson for linux here:

https://inano.au.dk/about/research-centers-and-projects/nmr/software/simpson 

and running the install.sh 

Note: I had to delete the file "libtcl8.6.so" in "/usr/share/simpson" otherwise I would get an error message about tcl version.
